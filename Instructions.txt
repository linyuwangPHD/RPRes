Due to space constraints, we store our data in other locations. 
Readers can download the data according to the URL in the file and put it in the corresponding folder.

After downloading the data, the process of using the software is as follows:

1. Using "H5_Data.py" to convert the original data into H5 format data.
2. Using "RNAProfile_Prediction.py" to training and validating the model based on the H5 data.
3. Using the saved model to get prediction results based on testing data.
